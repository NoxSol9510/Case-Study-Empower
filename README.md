# Case-Study
A case study on a game mechanic from Onmyoji: The Card Game
* Empower mechanic *
Card with the keyword 'Empower/Kai' when played will allow the player to choose to play the empowered effect instead
Once the Empower is chose, return the card to hand and remove the Empower effect from that card

What I am interested in is when Hiyoribou Haruki cards can add empower effect to some random cards in the deck.
initially I thought that each card can only hold a single empower effect from Hiyoribou Haruki but a single card can hold multiple effect
So I want to try and recreate this effect in code

**note**
The code will visulize in text base only (no graphic)
